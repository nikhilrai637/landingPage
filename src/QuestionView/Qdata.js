You want to assemble the maximum number of teams from them. There is a restriction for each team: the number of programmers in the team multiplied by the minimum skill among all programmers in the team must be at least x.

       Each programmer should belong to at most one team. Some programmers may be left without a team.

        She invited n guests of the first type and m guests of the second type to the party. They will come to the party in some order. After coming to the party, each guest will choose the type of cookie (vanilla or chocolate) to eat. There is a difference in the way how they choose that type:
        
        If there are v vanilla cookies and c chocolate cookies at the moment, when the guest comes, then
        
        if the guest of the first type: if v>c the guest selects a vanilla cookie. Otherwise, the guest selects a chocolate cookie.
        if the guest of the second type: if v>c the guest selects a chocolate cookie. Otherwise, the guest selects a vanilla cookie.`

        Qdescription : `There are two rival donut shops.

        The first shop sells donuts at retail: each donut costs a dollars.
        
        The second shop sells donuts only in bulk: box of b donuts costs c dollars. So if you want to buy x donuts from this shop, then you have to buy the smallest number of boxes such that the total number of donuts in them is greater or equal to x.
        
        You want to determine two positive integer values:
        
        how many donuts can you buy so that they are strictly cheaper in the first shop than in the second shop?
        how many donuts can you buy so that they are strictly cheaper in the second shop than in the first shop?
        If any of these values doesn't exist then that value should be equal to −1. If there are multiple possible answers, then print any of them.
        
        The printed values should be less or equal to 109. It can be shown that under the given constraints such values always exist if any values exist at all.`

        Lee thinks a regular n-sided (convex) polygon is beautiful if and only if he can rotate it in such a way that at least one of its edges is parallel to the OX-axis and at least one of its edges is parallel to the OY-axis at the same time.
        
        Recall that a regular n-sided polygon is a convex polygon with n vertices such that all the edges and angles are equal.

        Let's define a Rooted Dead Bush (RDB) of level n as a rooted tree constructed as described below.
        
        A rooted dead bush of level 1 is a single vertex. To construct an RDB of level i we, at first, construct an RDB of level i−1, then for each vertex u:
        
        if u has no children then we will add a single child to it;
        if u has one child then we will add two children to it;
        if u has more than one child, then we will skip it.`
